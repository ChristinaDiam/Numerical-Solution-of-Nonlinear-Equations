## Numerical Solution of Nonlinear Equations

This MATLAB script aims to numerically solve nonlinear equations using two methods: the Newton-Raphson (NR) method and the Bisection method.
The script is structured into sections (%%) where different equations are defined and solved. 

There is also a PDF file with the observations and results obtained.

### Functions used:
1. syndyasmos_D_NR (The combination of Bisection and Newton-Raphson (NR) methods.)
2. syndyasmos_D_T (The combination of Bisection and Secant methods.)
3. siglisi (Convergence)
